# AI Bot
AI chat app which generates responses when asked questions about a certain company.
The chat bot needs to be asked questions such as what is the payment method or how do you deliver prodcucts and it generates response.
It is an intelligent AI bot.
I used artificial neural networks to train the bot, and I created the train dataset.

## What I learnt:

- creating my own dataset for training a model
- using artificial neural networks to create the model
- deploying the model in a web application
- using django channels for the chat app
- using fetch api in Javascript for the chat app
